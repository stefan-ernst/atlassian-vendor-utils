# Clean CSV Script

This script will remove unnecessary columns from the marketplace license CSV with "Additional Insights". Since the columns can not be customized using the marketplace UI, you can adjust this
script to clean the CSV up after downloading.

The script will output a *_cleaned.csv file.
